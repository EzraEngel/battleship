Welcome to Battleship, where you sink your opponent before he sinks you. In this game, you'll play against the computer who will utilize only basic tactics to try to sink you.

To play:

If you run MacOS on a 64 bit architecture (any Mac after 2006 that's not sporting an M1 chip) the executable should work as advertised. For M1/M2/32bit architectures you'll need to recompile the programs with your own compilter (must be C++ 11 or higher). For windows systems you'll need to recompile, and you ALSO may need to change the sleep function to whatever it is for your operating system.

To run the executable:

1) Open your terminal.

2) Navigate to the directory where you compiled the program or downloaded the executable (battleship). Use the cd command to navigate--reference bash documentation if needed.

3) Run it by typing ./battleship.
